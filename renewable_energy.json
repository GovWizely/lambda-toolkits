Solar typically uses a photovoltaic (PV) cell, composed of semiconductor material, which combines some properties of metals and some properties of insulators. When light is absorbed by a semiconductor, photons of light can transfer their energy to electrons, allowing the electrons to flow through the material as electrical current.  The most common PV solar cell is crystalline silicon followed by  cadmium telluride (CdTe), a type of “thin film” solar cell. Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) uses mirrors to concentrate the energy from the sun to drive traditional steam turbines or engines that create electricity.  The thermal energy concentrated in a CSP plant can be stored and used to produce electricity when it is needed, day or night.",

Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power, which can be converted into electricity. The energy in the wind turns the propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor is connected to the main shaft, which spins a generator to create electricity. Medium-size wind power installations (100 kw - 20 MW) tend to be Distributed Wind projects. Most wind power installations of all sizes are located onshore, but a growing number of \"offshore\" utility-scale projects are being deployed, which require unique technology and services.",
