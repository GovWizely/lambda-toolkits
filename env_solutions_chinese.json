Nutrients stimulate the growth of microorganisms (including algae) and other aquatic vegetation in receiving waters, leading to decreased oxygen levels. Excess nutrients are a significant water quality concern in many of the nations waters and a leading cause of impairment of designated uses. Wastewater treatment facilities are increasingly being required to address this issue by implementing treatment processes that reduce effluent nutrient concentrations to levels that regulators deem sufficiently protective of the environment.",

It can be released into the environment through natural activities such as volcanic action, erosion of rocks, and forest fires. Industry practices such as copper smelting, mining and coal burning also contribute to arsenic in our environment. Because it occurs naturally in the environment and as a by-product of some agricultural and industrial activities, it can enter drinking water through the ground or as runoff into surface water sources. Human exposure to arsenic can cause both short and long term health effects.",
